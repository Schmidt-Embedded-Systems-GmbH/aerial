The algorithms behind this tool were developed jointly with David Basin and
Bhargav Bhatt. The theory is described in the paper draft:

Almost Event-Rate Independent Monitoring of Metric Temporal Logic
http://people.inf.ethz.ch/trayteld/papers/aerial/aerial.pdf

Aerial depends on a recent (>= 4.04.0) version of the OCaml compiler.
(An outdated PolyML implementation of Aerial referenced in the above
paper can be found in this repository under the tag 'poly'.)

To install ocaml and some additional libraries use opam - ocaml's 
package manager. For example:

    apt-get install opam
    opam switch 4.04.1
    eval $(opam config env)

then compile Aerial with

    make

to obtain a binary aerial.native file and

    ./aerial.native -fmla examples/test1.mtl -log examples/test2.log

to run an example.

    ./aerial.native -?

provides some additional hints about the tool's user interface.

This repository also contains the bash scripts used to generate log files and
run the experiments reported on in the above paper (directory experiments).
Some of the shell scripts assume the "aerial" and "monpoly" binary file to be
places inside of the experiments directory and a working installation of GNU
Parallel.
